# Welcome to tagger!

Have you ever been in need of a tagger that can tag a product or show a product as a favourite or some other purpose without writing much of a code? Tagger will tag items in the order being tagged. But wait. What if your user tag items in different days and you care about segregating them by date when displaying them back in a seperate page. No worries, you can set the tagger to remember dates of entry as well!
